									<h2><a href="#">Predicting Life Expectancy of Liver Cirrhosis<br />
									using Machine Learning Techniques</a></h2>
									<p>This Study looks at how different machine learning algorithms can be used to estimate life expectancy in individuals with liver cirrhosis. Using a dataset with 418 occurrences and 21 attributes, the study compares the efficiency of Linear Regression, Multi-Linear Regression, Random Forest, Decision Tree, Gaussian Naive Bayes, and Support Vector Machines (SVM) methods. When the accuracy of each model is evaluated, it is discovered that the Decision Tree algorithm has the best efficiency (87.73%), which is followed by the linear regression method (79.93%), Gaussian Naive Bayes algorithm (73.80%), SVM (72.39%), and the random forest algorithm (71.16%). The dissertation also uses Kaplan-Meier Survival analysis and the Cox-Hazard Proportional Method to determine the recovery time from liver cirrhosis and shows that the risk of liver cirrhosis reduces after 3000 days. The study emphasizes the predictive power of machine learning approaches and its consequences for public health and policy.</p>

									</header>
									<a href="#" class="image fit"><img src="images/smart parking.jpg" alt="" /></a>
									<p>The current lifestyle of the peoples in the universe is totally changed from the start of human civilization. Nowadays the density of living peoples in urban area gradually increasing year by year. For this reason we are facing more like lack of natural resources, pollution, traffic etc. Here we are noted the main problem towards parking in metro areas like Chennai, Bangalore, Mumbai, Delhi. When the people plan to travel somewhere within the cities first they are think about where to park our application. </p>

									<a href="#" class="image fit"><img src="images/data science in the age of covid.jpg" alt="" /></a>
									<p>The COVID - 19 outbreak has had an impact on many aspects of our daily lives. Especially in the sector of education, where students are required to participate in online education (distance learning), which keeps them away from interactive courses. Students lack practical experience and knowledge as a result of online learning, making it difficult for them to achieve their goals. This study focused on the difficulties that students and teachers experience when it comes to Distance Education.</p>

										<h2><a href="#">Factors Affecting Education During COVID-19 Using<br />
										Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning</a></h2>
									</header>
									<a href="#" class="image fit"><img src="images/education in covid.jpg" alt="" /></a>
									<p>The COVID-19 pandemic had an impact on many aspects of global economy, includes the sudden shutdown of educational facilities at several countries around the world. Most educational institutions have changed their online teaching and learning activities because of this abrupt closure, enabling students to submit assignments and complete assessments on different learning management systems from the comfort of their homes. During COVID-19, several factors will impact remote learning. The three primary factors are affordability, infrastructural and training. In this review, features are investigated and academic achievement of students throughout the pandemic is predicted using classification algorithms using Machine Learning. </p>

									<p>This coursework provides preliminary assessments COVID-19-related deaths in England's local authorities using population density, household, and health. COVID-19-related deaths that occurred between 2020 and 2022 are included. UK-wide By August 12th, the amount of COVID-19 reported cases and fatalities were 313,798 and 46,706, accordingly (70 deaths and 472 case per 100,000 population). Regional differences existed in England in comparison with other countries, with London, the North, and the West being disproportionately impacted (666 and 756 case per 100,000 population, accordingly). 13,618,470 analyzes had been completed in the UK as of August 11th. Male gender, mortality rate (65 years old), and selected groups were all linked to a higher chance of passing away. </p>

										<h2><a href="#">Productivity Prediction of <br />
										Garment Employees</a></h2>
									</header>
									<a href="#" class="image fit"><img src="images/garments.jpg" alt="" /></a>
									<p>In this modern era, Garment Industry plays a significant role in the Industrial globalization. It is one of the industries which is time consuming with more manual processes. The Garment industries are highly human indulgence and Satisfying global customers depends on the productâ€™s Quality and delivery performance of the employee in a particular Garment Industry. In case, of Productivity Failure, it results in huge losses. This course work aims to analyze and predict the Productivity range of Garment employees using Machine learning algorithms namely Classification and Regression. </p>
